Indium supports @code{Emacs 25.3+}, works with @code{Chrome} (debugging protocol
@code{v1.2}, see @ref{5,,Chrome/Chromium requirements}) and @code{NodeJS}, see
@ref{6,,NodeJS requirements}.

Indium works with @code{js-mode}, @code{js2-mode}, @code{js2-jsx-mode} and
@code{rjsx-mode}. It supports the ECMAScript features of the runtime it connects
to.

Indium is availabe on MELPA@footnote{https://melpa.org}, MELPA Stable@footnote{https://stable.melpa/org}.

@subsection The Indium server


Indium needs to communicate with a small server for evaluation and debugging.
Install the server with the following command (prepend @code{sudo} on GNU/Linux):

@example
npm install -g indium
@end example

@node Using MELPA,Manual installation,The Indium server,Installation
@anchor{installation using-melpa}@anchor{9}
@subsection Using MELPA


Unless you are already using MELPA, you will have to setup @code{package.el} to use
MELPA or MELPA Stable repositories.  You can follow this documentation@footnote{https://melpa.org/#/getting-started}.

You can install Indium with the following command:

@example
M-x package-install [RET] indium [RET]
@end example

or by adding this bit of Emacs Lisp code to your Emacs initialization file
(@code{.emacs} or @code{init.el}):

@example
(unless (package-installed-p 'indium)
  (package-install 'indium))
@end example

If the installation doesn’t work try refreshing the package list:

@example
M-x package-refresh-contents [RET]
@end example

@node Manual installation,,Using MELPA,Installation
@anchor{installation manual-installation}@anchor{a}
@subsection Manual installation


If you want to install Indium manually, make sure to install @code{websocket.el}.
Obtain the code of Indium from the repository@footnote{https://github.com/NicolasPetton/indium}.

Add the following to your Emacs configuration:

@example
;; load Indium from its source code
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/indium")
(require 'indium)
@end example

@subsection Project configuration


Place a @code{.indium.json} file in the root folder of your JavaScript project.
The project file can contain one or many configurations settings for NodeJS (see
@ref{10,,NodeJS configuration options}) and Chrome/Chromium (see
@ref{11,,Chrome/Chromium configuration options}).

Here is a minimalist @code{.indium.json} file.:

@example
@{
  "configurations": [
    @{
      "name": "Web project",
      "type": "chrome"
    @}
  ]
@}
@end example

@node General configuration,Chrome/Chromium configuration options,Project configuration,Getting up and running
@anchor{setup general-configuration}@anchor{12}@anchor{setup id1}@anchor{13}
@subsection General configuration


The @code{.indium.json} file can contain as many configurations as needed, and mix
any supported configuration types.

The currently supported @code{type} values are @code{"chrome"} and @code{"node"}.

The root directory of the source files is by default set to the directory where
this @code{.indium.json} file is placed, but it can be overridden with the @code{root}
(or the @code{webRoot} alias) option:

@example
@{
  "configurations": [
    @{
      "type": "chrome",
      "root": "src"
    @}
  ]
@}
@end example

Custom script path overrides can be set with @code{scriptPathOverrides}.  See
@ref{14,,Overriding script paths} for more information on script paths and debugging.

Custom sourcemap path overrides can be set with @code{sourceMapPathOverrides}.  See
@ref{15,,Using sourcemaps} for more information on sourcemaps and debugging.

@subsection Starting Indium


Indium can be started in two modes:


@itemize -

@item 
Connect: @code{M-x indium-connect} Connect indium to a running runtime from one
of the configurations in the @code{.indium.json} project file.

@item 
Launch: @code{M-x indium-launch} Start a JavaScript process (Chrome or NodeJS) as
specified from the configurations in the @code{.indium.json} project file.
@end itemize

@node NodeJS requirements,Chrome/Chromium requirements,Starting Indium,Getting up and running
@anchor{setup nodejs-requirements}@anchor{6}@anchor{setup id3}@anchor{1a}
@subsection NodeJS requirements


Nodejs >= @code{8.x} is required for Indium to work.

If your distribution ships an old version of NodeJS, you can install a more
recent version using nvm@footnote{https://github.com/creationix/nvm}:

@example
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash
@end example

Once @code{nvm} is install, you can easily install and use the version of NodeJS
you want:

@example
$ nvm install v8
$ nvm alias default v8
$ node --version
@end example

If you install NodeJS using @code{nvm}, chances are that Emacs won’t have it in its
@code{exec path}. A simple solution is to use the excellent exec-path-from-shell@footnote{https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell} package.

@node Chrome/Chromium requirements,,NodeJS requirements,Getting up and running
@anchor{setup chrome-requirements}@anchor{5}@anchor{setup chrome-chromium-requirements}@anchor{1b}
@subsection Chrome/Chromium requirements


Chrome/Chromium >= @code{60.0} is required for Indium to properly work (debugging
protocol @code{v1.2}).

When the variable @code{indium-chrome-use-temporary-profile} is non-nil (the
default), @code{M-x indium-launch} will start a new instance of Chrome/Chromium
with the remote debugging port set up.

Otherwise, you can start Chrome/Chromium with the @code{--remote-debugging-port}
flag like the following:

@example
chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222 https://localhost:3000
@end example

If you start Chrome manually, make sure that no instance of Chrome is already
running, otherwise Chrome will simply open a new tab on the existing Chrome
instance, and the @code{remote-debugging-port} will not be set.

@anchor{repl reconnecting-from-the-repl-buffer}@anchor{23}
@subsubsection Reconnecting from the REPL buffer


When a connection is closed (most probably because other devtools were open on
the same runtime), the REPL will display two buttons, one to try to reopen the
connection, and another one to kill Emacs buffers using this connection (the
REPL buffer, inspectors & debuggers).

@node Code evaluation & context,,Using the REPL,The REPL
@anchor{repl code-evaluation-context}@anchor{24}
@subsection Code evaluation & context


When evaluating code in the REPL, Indium will always run the code on the current
execution context.

This means that while debugging, code execution will happen in the context of
the current stack frame, and will be able to access local variables from the
stack, etc.

@anchor{code-evaluation doc}@anchor{25}@anchor{code-evaluation interaction}@anchor{26}@anchor{code-evaluation interaction-in-js-buffers}@anchor{27}
@section Interaction in JS buffers


Indium comes with a minor mode called @code{indium-interaction-mode} for interactive
programming. To enable it in all JavaScript buffers, add something
like the following to your Emacs configuration:

@example
(require 'indium)
(add-hook 'js-mode-hook #'indium-interaction-mode)
@end example

When @code{indium-interaction-mode} is on, you can evaluate code, inspect objects and
add or remove breakpoints from your buffers.

@subsection Adding and removing breakpoints


You need to first make sure that Indium is set up correctly to use local files
(see @ref{12,,General configuration}).


@itemize -

@item 
@code{C-c b b}: Add a breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b c}: Add a conditional breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b k}: Remove a breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b t}: Toggle a breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b K}: Remove all breakpoints from the current buffer

@item 
@code{C-c b e}: Edit condition of a breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b l}: List all breakpoints and easily jump to any breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b d}: Deactivate all breakpoints (the runtime won’t pause when hitting a breakpoint)

@item 
@code{C-c b a}: Activate all breakpoints (it has no effect if breakpoints have not been deactivated)
@end itemize

The left fringe or margin can also be clicked to add or remove breakpoints.

Once a breakpoint is set, execution will stop when a breakpoint is hit, and the
Indium debugger pops up (see @ref{2b,,The stepping debugger}).

Since Indium 0.7, breakpoints are supported in source files with an associated sourcemap, see @ref{15,,Using sourcemaps}.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Breakpoints are persistent: if the connection is closed, when a new
connection is made Indium will attempt to add back all breakpoints.

@subsection Using sourcemaps


Since version 0.7, Indium uses sourcemap files by default.

For sourcemaps to work properly with Chrome/Chromium, make sure that a
workspace is correctly set (see @ref{d,,Getting up and running}).

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
If your project uses sourcemaps, we advise you to use @code{js-mode}
with @code{js2-minor-mode} instead of @code{js2-mode}.  @code{js2-mode} can
be extremely slow at parsing large files (like compiled JavaScript
files) that the debugger might open if a stack frame source is not
source-mapped.  This can happen for instance when using Webpack.

@node Overriding sourcemap paths,Overriding script paths,,Using sourcemaps
@anchor{debugger overriding-sourcemap-paths}@anchor{2f}@anchor{debugger webpack}@anchor{30}
@subsubsection Overriding sourcemap paths


Some sourcemaps cannot be used as is and need path rewriting to map to locations on disks.

Indium provides the configuration option @code{sourceMapPathOverrides} for
providing custom sourcemap paths.

The default mapping works well for Webpack projects:

@example
@{
  "webpack:///./~/": "$@{root@}/node_modules/",
  "webpack:///./":   "$@{root@}/",
  "webpack:///":     "/",
  "webpack:///src/": "$@{root@}/"
@}
@end example

Overriding the @code{sourceMapPathOverrides} option will erase the default mapping.

@cartouche
@quotation Tip 
If sourcemaps do not seem to work, you can see how Indium resolves
sourcemap paths using @code{M-x indium-list-sourcemap-sources}.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@node Overriding script paths,,Overriding sourcemap paths,Using sourcemaps
@anchor{debugger scriptpaths}@anchor{14}@anchor{debugger overriding-script-paths}@anchor{31}
@subsubsection Overriding script paths


If your application’s script URLs don’t correspond directly to where
their source code is located, you can use @code{scriptPathOverrides} to
tell Indium where to find the sources.  It maps regular expressions to
Javascript substitution strings.

For example, if your project root is @code{/home/user/projects/foo/}, and
the source code for @indicateurl{http://localhost:3000/js/app.js/1234567890} is at
@code{/home/user/projects/foo/private/js/app.js}, you might set
@code{scriptPathOverrides} to:

@example
@{
  "(/js/.*\\.js)/[0-9]+": "private$1"
@}
@end example

This removes the trailing slash and digits, and it adds “private” to
the beginning of the path below the project root.

@node Blackboxing scripts,,Using sourcemaps,The stepping debugger
@anchor{debugger blackboxing-scripts}@anchor{32}

Issues should be reported on the GitHub issue tracker@footnote{https://github.com/nicolaspetton/indium/issues}.

1. If you encounter errors, you can enable @code{debug-on-error} in Emacs using @code{M-x
toggle-debug-on-error} and report an issue with the backtrace.

2. It is also a good idea to turn on Indium’s log mode with @code{M-: (setq
indium-client-debug t)}, and attach to the issue report the contents of the
@code{*indium-debug-log*} buffer to help resolve the issue.

Attaching the contents of the @code{*indium-process*} buffer can help as well in
case an error happens in the server process.

@subsection The Indium server doesn’t start


First, make sure that @code{indium} is installed as documented in the
@ref{8,,The Indium server} section.

If you encounter the error:

@example
"error in process filter: Indium server process error: env: node: No such file or directory"
@end example

Chances are that @code{node} is not in Emacs’ @code{exec-path}.  In this case, you can
fix it by appending the correct directory to @code{exec-path}, or use the
exec-path-from-shell@footnote{https://melpa.org/#/exec-path-from-shell} package:

@example
(require 'exec-path-from-shell)
(exec-path-from-shell-initialize)
@end example

@subsection Breakpoints are not set (not using sourcemaps)


If breakpoints do not work, chances are that the project is not configured
correctly.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Indium needs to know how to map script source urls to files on disk.
It uses the @code{root} (alias @code{webRoot}) configuration option as the
base path, as described in the @ref{12,,General configuration} page.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

Indium provides a command @code{indium-list-script-sources} to list all scripts

Correctly mapping sourcemaps to file locations can be tedious (see

configuring sourcemaps correctly.  This command displays a list of all
sourcemap sources in the runtime as file paths on disk.  Check that your files
are listed there.
