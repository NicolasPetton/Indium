Indium is a JavaScript development environment for Emacs@footnote{http://gnu.org/software/emacs}.

Indium is Free Software, licensed under the GPL v3.0.  You can follow its
development on GitHub@footnote{https://github.com/NicolasPetton/indium}.

Indium connects to a browser tab or nodejs process and provides several features
for JavaScript development, including:


@itemize *

@item 
a REPL (with auto completion) & object inspection;

@item 
an inspector, with history and navigation;

@item 
a scratch buffer (@code{M-x indium-scratch});

@item 
JavaScript evaluation in JS buffers with @code{indium-interaction-mode};

@item 
a stepping Debugger, similar to @code{edebug}, or @code{cider}.
@end itemize

This documentation can be read online at @indicateurl{https://indium.readthedocs.io}.

It is also available in Info format and can be consulted from within Emacs with
@code{C-h i m indium RET}.

@end quotation
@end cartouche

Indium supports @code{Emacs 25.1+}, @code{Chrome 54.0+} (debugging protocol @code{v1.2})
and @code{NodeJS 7+}.

Indium is availabe on MELPA@footnote{https://melpa.org}, MELPA Stable@footnote{https://stable.melpa/org}.

@subsection Using MELPA


Unless you are already using MELPA, you will have to setup @code{package.el} to use
MELPA or MELPA Stable repositories.  You can follow this documentation@footnote{https://melpa.org/#/getting-started}.

You can install Indium with the following command:

@example
M-x package-install [RET] indium [RET]
@end example

or by adding this bit of Emacs Lisp code to your Emacs initialization file
(@code{.emacs} or @code{init.el}):

@example
(unless (package-installed-p 'indium)
  (package-install 'indium))
@end example

If the installation doesn't work try refreshing the package list:

@example
M-x package-refresh-contents [RET]
@end example

@node Manual installation,,Using MELPA,Installation
@anchor{installation manual-installation}@anchor{6}
@subsection Manual installation


If you want to install Indium manually, make sure to install @code{websocket.el}.
Obtain the code of Indium from the repository@footnote{https://github.com/NicolasPetton/indium}.

Add the following to your Emacs configuration:

@example
;; load Indium from its source code
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/indium")
(require 'indium)
@end example

@anchor{setup id1}@anchor{a}@anchor{setup nodejs}@anchor{b}
@subsection NodeJS


Nodejs >= @code{7.0} is required for Indium to work.

Start a node process with the @code{--inspect} flag:

@example
node --inspect myfile.js
@end example

If you wish to break on the first line of the application code, start node using:

@example
node --inspect --debug-brk myfile.js
@end example

Node will tell you to open an URL in Chrome:

@example
chrome-devtools://inspector.html?...&ws=127.0.0.1:PORT/PATH
@end example

Evaluate @code{M-x indium-connect-to-nodejs RET 127.0.0.1 RET PORT RET PATH},
@code{PORT} and @code{PATH} are the ones from the @cite{ws} parameter of the above URL.

Connecting Indium to the node process will open a debugger on the first line of
the application code if you passed the CLI argument @code{--debug-brk}.

@node Chrome/Chromium,Using local files when debugging,NodeJS,Getting up and running
@anchor{setup chrome-chromium}@anchor{c}@anchor{setup chrome}@anchor{d}
@subsection Chrome/Chromium


Chrome/Chromium >= @code{54.0} is required for Indium to properly work (debugging
protocol @code{v1.2}).

Start Chrome/Chromium with the @code{--remote-debugging-port} flag like the following:

@example
chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222 https://localhost:3000
@end example

Make sure that no instance of Chrome is already running, otherwise Chrome will
simply open a new tab on the existing Chrome instance, and the
@code{remote-debugging-port} will not be set.

To connect to a tab, run from Emacs:

@example
M-x indium-connect-to-chrome
@end example

@node Using local files when debugging,,Chrome/Chromium,Getting up and running
@anchor{setup using-local-files-when-debugging}@anchor{e}@anchor{setup local-files}@anchor{f}
@subsection Using local files when debugging


Indium can use local files when debugging, or to set breakpoints.

@cartouche
@quotation Hint 
When using @code{NodeJS}, or when the connected tab uses the @code{file://}
URL, Indium will by itself use local files from disk.  In this case
there is nothing to setup.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

If the Chrome connection uses the @code{http://} or @code{https://} protocol, you will
have to tell Indium where to find the corresponding JavaScript files on disk by
setting up a workspace.

To do that, place an empty @code{.indium} marker file in the root folder where your
@strong{web server serves static files}.

The root folder where the @code{.indium} file should be put is not always the
directory that contains your JavaScript files. It should be the root folder
containing static files. Most of the time, it is at least one level above.

Given the following project structure:

@example
project/ (current directory)
   www/
      index.html
      css/
         style.css
      js/
         app.js
      .indium
@end example

Indium will lookup the file @code{www/js/app.js} for the URL
"@indicateurl{http://localhost:3000/js/app.js}".

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
In order for this setup to work, make sure to call
@code{indium-connect-to-chrome} from somewhere within the workspace
directory!

@subsection Starting a REPL


A REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) buffer is automatically open when a new Indium
connection is made (see @ref{9,,Getting up and running}).

@image{repl,,,,png}

The REPL offers the following features:


@itemize *

@item 
Auto completion with @code{company-mode}

@item 
JS syntax highlighting

@item 
Pretty printing and preview of printed values

@item 
Access to the object inspector (see @ref{14,,The inspector})

@end multitable


@node Reconnecting from the REPL buffer,,Keybindings,Using the REPL
@anchor{repl reconnecting-from-the-repl-buffer}@anchor{17}
@subsubsection Reconnecting from the REPL buffer


When a connection is closed (most probably because other devtools were open on
the same runtime), the REPL will display two buttons, one to try to reopen the
connection, and another one to kill Emacs buffers using this connection (the
REPL buffer, inspectors & debuggers).

@node Code evaluation & context,,Using the REPL,The REPL
@anchor{repl code-evaluation-context}@anchor{18}
@subsection Code evaluation & context


When evaluating code in the REPL, Indium will always run the code on the current
execution context.

This means that while debugging, code execution will happen in the context of
the current stack frame, and will be able to access local variables from the
stack, etc.

@anchor{code-evaluation interaction-in-js-buffers}@anchor{19}@anchor{code-evaluation interaction}@anchor{1a}@anchor{code-evaluation doc}@anchor{1b}
@section Interaction in JS buffers


Indium comes with a minor mode called @code{indium-interaction-mode} for interactive
programming. To enable it in all JavaScript buffers, add something
like the following to your Emacs configuration:

@example
(require 'indium)
(add-hook 'js-mode-hook #'indium-interaction-mode)
@end example

When @code{indium-interaction-mode} is on, you can evaluate code, inspect objects and
add or remove breakpoints from your buffers.

@subsection Evaluating and inspecting


Here's a list of available keybindings:


@itemize -

@item 
@code{C-x C-e}: Evaluate the JavaScript expression preceding the point.

@item 
@code{C-M-x}: Evaluate the innermost function enclosing the point.

@item 
@code{C-c M-i}: Inspect the result of the evaluation of an expression (see
@ref{14,,The inspector}).

@item 
@code{M-x indium-eval-buffer}: Evaluate the entire buffer.
@end itemize

@node Switching to the REPL buffer,Adding and removing breakpoints,Evaluating and inspecting,Interaction in JS buffers
@anchor{code-evaluation switching-to-the-repl-buffer}@anchor{1d}
@subsection Switching to the REPL buffer


Press @code{C-c C-z} from any buffer with @code{indium-interaction-mode} turned on to
switch back to the REPL buffer (see @ref{10,,The REPL}).

@node Adding and removing breakpoints,Live code update hot-swapping JavaScript sources,Switching to the REPL buffer,Interaction in JS buffers
@anchor{code-evaluation adding-and-removing-breakpoints}@anchor{1e}
@subsection Adding and removing breakpoints


You need to first make sure that Indium is set up correctly to use local files
(see @ref{f,,Using local files when debugging}).


@itemize -

@item 
@code{C-c b b}: Toggle a breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-u C-c b b}: Toggle a breakpoint with condition

@item 
@code{C-c b K}: Remove all breakpoints from the current buffer
@end itemize

Once a breakpoint is set, execution will stop when a breakpoint is hit, and the
Indium debugger pops up (see @ref{1f,,The stepping debugger}).

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Breakpoints are persistent: if the connection is closed, when a new
connection is made Indium will attempt to add back all breakpoints.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@node Live code update hot-swapping JavaScript sources,,Adding and removing breakpoints,Interaction in JS buffers
@anchor{code-evaluation live-code-update-hot-swapping-javascript-sources}@anchor{20}
@subsection Live code update (hot-swapping JavaScript sources)


Indium supports live code updates without the need to reload the browser tab or
restart the nodejs process.

This feature works with by hot-swapping the script source, and works even with
lexical closures.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
This feature currently in only available for Chrome & Chromium.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
Stability issues have been reported when using this feature with
Chrome 57 and earlier.  We strongly encourage you to use Chrome >=
58 when using live code updates.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

To enable live updates, make sure Indium is set up to use local files (see
@ref{f,,Using local files when debugging}).


@itemize -

@item 
@code{C-c C-k}: Updates the runtime JavaScript source with the contents of the
current buffer.

@item 
@code{(setq indium-update-script-on-save t)}: Automatically update the runtime
script JavaScript source after each buffer save.
@end itemize

You can setup a hook to be run after each script update. For example

@example
(add-hook 'indium-update-script-source-hook
        (lambda (url)
          (indium-eval (format "window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('patch', @{detail: @{url: '%s'@}@}))"
                               url))))
@end example

Then you can use it in your app for development purposes

@example
window.addEventListener("patch", (event) => @{
  console.log("Patched @@ " + new Date().toTimeString().substring(0, 8), event.detail.url);
  // rerender, etc
@});
@end example
