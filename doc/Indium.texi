Indium is a JavaScript development environment for Emacs@footnote{http://gnu.org/software/emacs}.

Indium is Free Software, licensed under the GPL v3.0.  You can follow its
development on GitHub@footnote{https://github.com/NicolasPetton/indium}.

Indium connects to a browser tab or nodejs process and provides several features
for JavaScript development, including:


@itemize *

@item 
a REPL (with auto completion) & object inspection;

@item 
an inspector, with history and navigation;

@item 
a scratch buffer (@code{M-x indium-scratch});

@item 
JavaScript evaluation in JS buffers with @code{indium-interaction-mode};

@item 
a stepping Debugger, similar to @code{edebug}, or @code{cider}.
@end itemize

This documentation can be read online at @indicateurl{https://indium.readthedocs.io} and in
Info format (within Emacs with @code{(info "Indium")}).

It is also available in Info format and can be consulted from within Emacs with
@code{C-h i m indium RET}.

@subsection Using MELPA


Unless you are already using MELPA, you will have to setup @code{package.el} to use
MELPA or MELPA Stable repositories.  You can follow this documentation@footnote{https://melpa.org/#/getting-started}.

You can install Indium with the following command:

@example
M-x package-install [RET] indium [RET]
@end example

or by adding this bit of Emacs Lisp code to your Emacs initialization file
(@code{.emacs} or @code{init.el}):

@example
(unless (package-installed-p 'indium)
  (package-install 'indium))
@end example

If the installation doesn’t work try refreshing the package list:

@example
M-x package-refresh-contents [RET]
@end example

@node Manual installation,,Using MELPA,Installation
@anchor{installation manual-installation}@anchor{8}
@subsection Manual installation


If you want to install Indium manually, make sure to install @code{websocket.el}.
Obtain the code of Indium from the repository@footnote{https://github.com/NicolasPetton/indium}.

Add the following to your Emacs configuration:

@example
;; load Indium from its source code
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/indium")
(require 'indium)

@anchor{setup project-configuration}@anchor{c}@anchor{setup configuration-file}@anchor{d}
@subsection Project configuration


Place a @code{.indium.json} file in the root folder of your JavaScript project.
The project file can contain one or many configurations settings for NodeJS (see
@ref{e,,NodeJS configuration options}) and Chrome/Chromium (see
@ref{f,,Chrome/Chromium configuration options}).

Here is a minimalist @code{.indium.json} file.:

@example
@{
  "configurations": [
    @{
      "name": "Web project",
      "type": "chrome"
    @}
  ]
@}
@end example

@node General configuration,Chrome/Chromium configuration options,Project configuration,Getting up and running
@anchor{setup id1}@anchor{10}@anchor{setup general-configuration}@anchor{11}
@subsection General configuration


The @code{.indium.json} file can contain as many configurations as needed, and mix
any supported configuration types.

The currently supported @code{type} values are @code{"chrome"} and @code{"node"}.

The root directory of the source files is by default set to the directory where
this @code{.indium.json} file is placed, but it can be overridden with the @code{root}
(or the @code{webRoot} alias) option:

@example
@{
  "configurations": [
    @{
      "type": "chrome",
      "root": "src"
    @}
  ]
@}
@end example

Custom sourcemap path overrides can be set with @code{sourceMapPathOverrides}, see
@ref{12,,Using sourcemaps} for mode information on sourcemaps and debugging.

@subsection Starting Indium


Indium can be started in two modes:


@itemize -

@item 
Connect: @code{M-x indium-connect} Connect indium to a running runtime from one
of the configurations in the @code{.indium.json} project file.

@item 
Launch: @code{M-x indium-launch} Start a JavaScript process (Chrome or NodeJS) as
specified from the configurations in the @code{.indium.json} project file.
@end itemize

@node NodeJS requirements,Chrome/Chromium requirements,Starting Indium,Getting up and running
@anchor{setup nodejs-requirements}@anchor{6}@anchor{setup id3}@anchor{17}
@subsection NodeJS requirements


Nodejs >= @code{8.x} is required for Indium to work.

If your distribution ships an old version of NodeJS, you can install a more
recent version using nvm@footnote{https://github.com/creationix/nvm}:

@example
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash
@end example

Once @code{nvm} is install, you can easily install and use the version of NodeJS
you want:

@example
$ nvm install v8
$ nvm alias default v8
$ node --version
@end example

If you install NodeJS using @code{nvm}, chances are that Emacs won’t have it in its
@code{exec path}. A simple solution is to use the excellent exec-path-from-shell@footnote{https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell} package.

@node Chrome/Chromium requirements,,NodeJS requirements,Getting up and running
@anchor{setup chrome-chromium-requirements}@anchor{18}@anchor{setup chrome-requirements}@anchor{5}
@subsection Chrome/Chromium requirements


Chrome/Chromium >= @code{60.0} is required for Indium to properly work (debugging
protocol @code{v1.2}).

Start Chrome/Chromium with the @code{--remote-debugging-port} flag like the following:

@example
chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222 https://localhost:3000
@end example

Make sure that no instance of Chrome is already running, otherwise Chrome will
simply open a new tab on the existing Chrome instance, and the
@code{remote-debugging-port} will not be set.

@node Reconnecting from the REPL buffer,,Keybindings,Using the REPL
@anchor{repl reconnecting-from-the-repl-buffer}@anchor{20}
@subsubsection Reconnecting from the REPL buffer


When a connection is closed (most probably because other devtools were open on
the same runtime), the REPL will display two buttons, one to try to reopen the
connection, and another one to kill Emacs buffers using this connection (the
REPL buffer, inspectors & debuggers).

@node Code evaluation & context,,Using the REPL,The REPL
@anchor{repl code-evaluation-context}@anchor{21}
@subsection Code evaluation & context


When evaluating code in the REPL, Indium will always run the code on the current
execution context.

This means that while debugging, code execution will happen in the context of
the current stack frame, and will be able to access local variables from the
stack, etc.

@anchor{code-evaluation interaction-in-js-buffers}@anchor{22}@anchor{code-evaluation interaction}@anchor{23}@anchor{code-evaluation doc}@anchor{24}
@section Interaction in JS buffers


Indium comes with a minor mode called @code{indium-interaction-mode} for interactive
programming. To enable it in all JavaScript buffers, add something
like the following to your Emacs configuration:

@example
(require 'indium)
(add-hook 'js-mode-hook #'indium-interaction-mode)
@end example

When @code{indium-interaction-mode} is on, you can evaluate code, inspect objects and
add or remove breakpoints from your buffers.

@item 
@code{C-M-x}: Evaluate the innermost function enclosing the point.

@item 
@code{C-c M-i}: Inspect the result of the evaluation of an expression (see
@ref{1d,,The inspector}).

@item 
@code{C-c M-:}: Prompt for an expression to evaluate and inspect.

@node Adding and removing breakpoints,Live code update hot-swapping JavaScript sources,Switching to the REPL buffer,Interaction in JS buffers
@anchor{code-evaluation adding-and-removing-breakpoints}@anchor{27}
@subsection Adding and removing breakpoints


You need to first make sure that Indium is set up correctly to use local files
(see local-files).


@itemize -

@item 
@code{C-c b b}: Add a breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b c}: Add a conditional breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b k}: Remove a breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b t}: Toggle a breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b K}: Remove all breakpoints from the current buffer

@item 
@code{C-c b e}: Edit condition of a breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b l}: List all breakpoints and easily jump to any breakpoint

@item 
@code{C-c b d}: Deactivate all breakpoints (the runtime won’t pause when hitting a breakpoint)

@item 
@code{C-c b a}: Activate all breakpoints (it has no effect if breakpoints have not been deactivated)
@end itemize

The left fringe or margin can also be clicked to add or remove breakpoints.

Once a breakpoint is set, execution will stop when a breakpoint is hit, and the
Indium debugger pops up (see @ref{28,,The stepping debugger}).

Since Indium 0.7, breakpoints are supported in source files with an associated sourcemap, see @ref{12,,Using sourcemaps}.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
Breakpoints are persistent: if the connection is closed, when a new
connection is made Indium will attempt to add back all breakpoints.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@node Live code update hot-swapping JavaScript sources,,Adding and removing breakpoints,Interaction in JS buffers
@anchor{code-evaluation live-code-update-hot-swapping-javascript-sources}@anchor{29}
@subsection Live code update (hot-swapping JavaScript sources)


Indium supports live code updates without the need to reload the browser tab or
restart the nodejs process.

This feature works with by hot-swapping the script source, and works even with
lexical closures.

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
This feature currently in only available for Chrome & Chromium.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

To enable live updates, make sure Indium is set up to use local files (see
local-files).


@itemize -

@item 
@code{C-c C-k}: Updates the runtime JavaScript source with the contents of the
current buffer (this is also done automatically when a buffer is saved).
@end itemize

You can setup a hook to be run after each script update. For example

@example
(add-hook 'indium-update-script-source-hook
        (lambda (url)
          (indium-eval (format "window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('patch', @{detail: @{url: '%s'@}@}))"
                               url))))
@end example

Then you can use it in your app for development purposes

@example
window.addEventListener("patch", (event) => @{
  console.log("Patched @@ " + new Date().toTimeString().substring(0, 8), event.detail.url);
  // rerender, etc
@});
@end example

@subsection Using sourcemaps


Since version 0.7, Indium uses sourcemap files by default.

For sourcemaps to work properly with Chrome/Chromium, make sure that a
workspace is correctly set (see @ref{9,,Getting up and running}).

If you wish to disable sourcemaps when debugging, set @code{indium-script-enable-sourcemaps} to @code{nil}.

@end menu

@node Overriding sourcemap paths,,,Using sourcemaps
@anchor{debugger overriding-sourcemap-paths}@anchor{2d}@anchor{debugger webpack}@anchor{2e}
@subsubsection Overriding sourcemap paths


Some sourcemaps cannot be used as is and need path rewriting to map to locations on disks.

Indium provides the configuration option @code{sourceMapPathOverrides} for
providing custom sourcemap paths.

The default mapping works well for Webpack projects:

@example
@{
  "webpack:///./~/": "$@{root@}/node_modules/",
  "webpack:///./":   "$@{root@}/",
  "webpack:///":     "/",
  "webpack:///src/": "$@{root@}/"
@}
@end example

Overriding the @code{sourceMapPathOverrides} option will erase the default mapping.

@node Blackboxing scripts,,Using sourcemaps,The stepping debugger
@anchor{debugger blackboxing-scripts}@anchor{2f}
@subsection Blackboxing scripts


The custom variable @code{indium-debugger-blackbox-regexps} holds a list of regular
expression of script paths to blackbox when debugging.

Blackboxed scripts are skipped when stepping in the debugger.

Indium features an object inspector that can be open on any object reference
from a REPL buffer (see @ref{19,,The REPL}), the debugger (see @ref{28,,The stepping debugger}), or
the result of any evaluation of JavaScript code (see @ref{23,,Interaction in JS buffers}).

To inspect the result of the evaluation of an expression, press @code{C-c M-i}.  An
inspector buffer will pop up.  You can also press @code{RET} or left click on
object links from the REPL buffer.
