     Copyright © 2017, Nicolas Petton

Indium is a JavaScript development environment for Emacs(1).

Indium is Free Software, licensed under the GPL v3.0.  You can follow
its development on GitHub(2).

Indium connects to a browser tab or nodejs process and provides several
features for JavaScript development, including:

   * a REPL (with auto completion) & object inspection;

   * an inspector, with history and navigation;

   * a scratch buffer (‘M-x indium-scratch’);

   * JavaScript evaluation in JS buffers with ‘indium-interaction-mode’;

   * a stepping Debugger, similar to ‘edebug’, or ‘cider’.

This documentation can be read online at
‘https://indium.readthedocs.io’.

It is also available in Info format and can be consulted from within
Emacs with ‘C-h i m indium RET’.

1.1 Installation
================

     Note: If you already have installed ‘Jade’, you should read the
     migration-from-jade page first.

Indium supports ‘Emacs 25.1+’, ‘Chrome 54.0+’ (debugging protocol
‘v1.2’) and ‘NodeJS 7+’.

Indium is availabe on MELPA(1), MELPA Stable(2).

1.1.1 Using MELPA
-----------------

Unless you are already using MELPA, you will have to setup ‘package.el’
to use MELPA or MELPA Stable repositories.  You can follow this
documentation(1).

You can install Indium with the following command:

     M-x package-install [RET] indium [RET]

or by adding this bit of Emacs Lisp code to your Emacs initialization
file (‘.emacs’ or ‘init.el’):

     (unless (package-installed-p 'indium)
       (package-install 'indium))

If the installation doesn’t work try refreshing the package list:

     M-x package-refresh-contents [RET]

1.1.2 Manual installation
-------------------------

If you want to install Indium manually, make sure to install
‘websocket.el’.  Obtain the code of Indium from the repository(1).

Add the following to your Emacs configuration:

     ;; load Indium from its source code
     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/indium")
     (require 'indium)

File: Indium.info,  Node: NodeJS,  Next: Chrome/Chromium,  Up: Getting up and running

1.2.1 NodeJS
------------

Nodejs >= ‘7.0’ is required for Indium to work.

Start a node process with the ‘--inspect’ flag:

     node --inspect myfile.js

If you wish to break on the first line of the application code, start
node using:

     node --inspect --debug-brk myfile.js

Node will tell you to open an URL in Chrome:

     chrome-devtools://inspector.html?...&ws=127.0.0.1:PORT/PATH

Evaluate ‘M-x indium-connect-to-nodejs RET 127.0.0.1 RET PORT RET PATH’,
‘PORT’ and ‘PATH’ are the ones from the ‘ws’ parameter of the above URL.

Connecting Indium to the node process will open a debugger on the first
line of the application code if you passed the CLI argument
‘--debug-brk’.


File: Indium.info,  Node: Chrome/Chromium,  Next: Using local files when debugging,  Prev: NodeJS,  Up: Getting up and running

1.2.2 Chrome/Chromium
---------------------

Chrome/Chromium >= ‘54.0’ is required for Indium to properly work
(debugging protocol ‘v1.2’).

Start Chrome/Chromium with the ‘--remote-debugging-port’ flag like the
following:

     chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222 https://localhost:3000

Make sure that no instance of Chrome is already running, otherwise
Chrome will simply open a new tab on the existing Chrome instance, and
the ‘remote-debugging-port’ will not be set.

To connect to a tab, run from Emacs:

     M-x indium-connect-to-chrome


File: Indium.info,  Node: Using local files when debugging,  Prev: Chrome/Chromium,  Up: Getting up and running

1.2.3 Using local files when debugging
--------------------------------------

Indium can use local files when debugging, or to set breakpoints.

     Hint: When using ‘NodeJS’, or when the connected tab uses the
     ‘file://’ URL, Indium will by itself use local files from disk.  In
     this case there is nothing to setup.

If the Chrome connection uses the ‘http://’ or ‘https://’ protocol, you
will have to tell Indium where to find the corresponding JavaScript
files on disk by setting up a workspace.

To do that, place an empty ‘.indium’ marker file in the root folder
where your `web server serves static files'.

The root folder where the ‘.indium’ file should be put is not always the
directory that contains your JavaScript files.  It should be the root
folder containing static files.  Most of the time, it is at least one
level above.

Given the following project structure:

     project/ (current directory)
        www/
           index.html
           css/
              style.css
           js/
              app.js
           .indium

Indium will lookup the file ‘www/js/app.js’ for the URL
"‘http://localhost:3000/js/app.js’".

     Warning: In order for this setup to work, make sure to call
     ‘indium-connect-to-chrome’ from somewhere within the workspace
     directory!

1.3.1 Starting a REPL
---------------------

A REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) buffer is automatically open when a new
Indium connection is made (see *note Getting up and running: 9.).

 [image src="repl.png" ]

The REPL offers the following features:

   * Auto completion with ‘company-mode’

   * JS syntax highlighting

   * Pretty printing and preview of printed values

   * Access to the object inspector (see *note The inspector: 14.)

...................

Here is the list of available keybindings in a REPL buffer:

Keybinding        Description
                  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  
‘RET’             Evalute the current input.  When the point is on a printed object, inspect the object.
                  
                  
‘C-RET’           Insert a newline.
                  
                  
‘C-c M-i’         Evalute the current input and open an inspector on the result.
                  
                  
‘C-c C-o’         Clear the output.
                  
                  
‘C-c C-q’         Kill the REPL buffer and close the current connection.
                  
                  
‘M-n’             Insert the previous input in the history.
                  
                  
‘M-p’             Instert the next input in the history.

1.3.2.2 Reconnecting from the REPL buffer
.........................................

When a connection is closed (most probably because other devtools were
open on the same runtime), the REPL will display two buttons, one to try
to reopen the connection, and another one to kill Emacs buffers using
this connection (the REPL buffer, inspectors & debuggers).


File: Indium.info,  Node: Code evaluation & context,  Prev: Using the REPL,  Up: The REPL

1.3.3 Code evaluation & context
-------------------------------

When evaluating code in the REPL, Indium will always run the code on the
current execution context.

This means that while debugging, code execution will happen in the
context of the current stack frame, and will be able to access local
variables from the stack, etc.


File: Indium.info,  Node: Interaction in JS buffers,  Next: The stepping debugger,  Prev: The REPL,  Up: Table of contents

1.4 Interaction in JS buffers
=============================

Indium comes with a minor mode called ‘indium-interaction-mode’ for
interactive programming.  To enable it in all JavaScript buffers, add
something like the following to your Emacs configuration:

     (require 'indium)
     (add-hook 'js-mode-hook #'indium-interaction-mode)

When ‘indium-interaction-mode’ is on, you can evaluate code, inspect
objects and add or remove breakpoints from your buffers.

* Menu:

* Evaluating and inspecting:: 
* Switching to the REPL buffer:: 
* Adding and removing breakpoints:: 
* Live code update (hot-swapping JavaScript sources): Live code update hot-swapping JavaScript sources. 


File: Indium.info,  Node: Evaluating and inspecting,  Next: Switching to the REPL buffer,  Up: Interaction in JS buffers

1.4.1 Evaluating and inspecting
-------------------------------

Here’s a list of available keybindings:

   - ‘C-x C-e’: Evaluate the JavaScript expression preceding the point.

   - ‘C-M-x’: Evaluate the innermost function enclosing the point.

   - ‘C-c M-i’: Inspect the result of the evaluation of an expression
     (see *note The inspector: 14.).

   - ‘M-x indium-eval-buffer’: Evaluate the entire buffer.


File: Indium.info,  Node: Switching to the REPL buffer,  Next: Adding and removing breakpoints,  Prev: Evaluating and inspecting,  Up: Interaction in JS buffers

1.4.2 Switching to the REPL buffer
----------------------------------

Press ‘C-c C-z’ from any buffer with ‘indium-interaction-mode’ turned on
to switch back to the REPL buffer (see *note The REPL: 11.).


File: Indium.info,  Node: Adding and removing breakpoints,  Next: Live code update hot-swapping JavaScript sources,  Prev: Switching to the REPL buffer,  Up: Interaction in JS buffers

1.4.3 Adding and removing breakpoints
-------------------------------------

You need to first make sure that Indium is set up correctly to use local
files (see *note Using local files when debugging: e.).

   - ‘C-c b b’: Toggle a breakpoint

   - ‘C-u C-c b b’: Toggle a breakpoint with condition

   - ‘C-c b K’: Remove all breakpoints from the current buffer

Once a breakpoint is set, execution will stop when a breakpoint is hit,
and the Indium debugger pops up (see *note The stepping debugger: 1f.).

     Note: Breakpoints are persistent: if the connection is closed, when
     a new connection is made Indium will attempt to add back all
     breakpoints.


File: Indium.info,  Node: Live code update hot-swapping JavaScript sources,  Prev: Adding and removing breakpoints,  Up: Interaction in JS buffers

1.4.4 Live code update (hot-swapping JavaScript sources)
--------------------------------------------------------

Indium supports live code updates without the need to reload the browser
tab or restart the nodejs process.

This feature works with by hot-swapping the script source, and works
even with lexical closures.

     Note: This feature currently in only available for Chrome &
     Chromium.

     Warning: Stability issues have been reported when using this
     feature with Chrome 57 and earlier.  We strongly encourage you to
     use Chrome >= 58 when using live code updates.

To enable live updates, make sure Indium is set up to use local files
(see *note Using local files when debugging: e.).

   - ‘C-c C-k’: Updates the runtime JavaScript source with the contents
     of the current buffer.

   - ‘(setq indium-update-script-on-save t)’: Automatically update the
     runtime script JavaScript source after each buffer save.

1.6 The inspector
=================

Indium features an object inspector that can be open on any object
reference from a REPL buffer (see *note The REPL: 11.), the debugger
(see *note The stepping debugger: 1f.), or the result of any evaluation
of JavaScript code (see *note Interaction in JS buffers: 19.).

To inspect the result of the evaluation of an expression, press ‘C-c
M-i’.  An inspector buffer will pop up.  You can also press ‘RET’ or
left click on object links from the REPL buffer.
