;;; Commentary:

;; Indium connects to a browser tab or nodejs process and provides many features
;; for JavaScript development, including a REPL (with auto completion) & object
;; inspection, an inspector, with history and navigation, and even a stepping
;; Debugger, similar to `edebug`, or `cider`.

;;; Code:

;; HACK: In Emacs 25.1, an older version of seq.el is provided, which can be
;; loaded before indium or even package.el.  If this happens, the feature `seq'
;; being already provided, the correct version of seq.el won't get loaded.
