;;; Commentary:

;; Setup a workspace for using local files when debugging JavaScript.
;;
;; Files are looked up using a special `.indium' file placed in the root directory
;; of the files served.
;;

;;; Example:

;; With the following directory structure:
;;
;; project/ (current directory)
;;    www/
;;       index.html
;;       css/
;;          style.css
;;       js/
;;          app.js
;;       .indium
;;
;; For the following URL "http://localhost:3000/js/app.js"
;; `indium-workspace-lookup-file' will return "./www/js/app.js".
;;
;; Previously used workspace directories are saved and stored in
;; "~/.emacs.d/indium-workspaces.el".  You can change its location by
;; customizing `indium-workspace-file'.
;;
;; To disable persisting the list of workspaces to a file, you can set
;; `indium-workspace-use-workspace-file' to `nil'.  In this case,
;; `indium-workspaces' can be manually set in your emacs.d.
